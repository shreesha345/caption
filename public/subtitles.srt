now

23
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,340
But

24
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:08,680
we

25
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:08,800

00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:15,900
thought

50
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,100
There

51
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,200
was

52
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,340
a

this

64
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,200
ecosystem

65
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,560
With

66
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:22,640
the

69
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,560
Because

70
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:24,840
this

71
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,200
ecosystem

72
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Is

73
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:26,800
very

the

103
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:36,720
code so

104
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:36,960
what

105
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,560

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,700
sounds

109
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:38,920
like

110
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,100
when

111
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,220
we

112
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:39,860
used

113
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:39,980

When

124
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,260
we

125
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,340
listen

126
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,540

never

132
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,380
thought

133
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:45,640
why

134
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,240
we

135
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,460
